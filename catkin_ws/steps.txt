Commands are: 
1. sudo su root
2. . devel/setup.bash      (for letting rosrun discover the camera_motor package of ours - the bash file sets up enviornment)
3. cd to catkin_ws if not already there
4. rosrun camera_motor listener.py or talker.py     (the tab completion should be working - you might need to shells)
